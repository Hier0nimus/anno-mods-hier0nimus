## Used GUIDs:

	1957006104	silver ore fake factory (for docklands)


## Content
- "Silver Ore" is defined as a product for all Vanilla regions. The New World and the Arctic are registered as production regions.
- This new product is added to the Standard Product List (120055). All other list entries have to be done by interested mods which should take care about possible double entries.
- Silver ore is also added to the good stock of the Docklands trader "Qinsa Mining".
- The mod defines a fake factory producing silver ore to make sure that the product's price always is correctly calculated in the Docklands, even when accessing mods don't implement an own silver ore production.
	Therefore, mods with own silver ore mines (or other types of producing units) have to set their "IsMainFactory" to "0".


## Language Support
This mod supports all basically implemented languages in Anno 1800.


## Known Issues
There aren't any known issues at the moment.


## Changelog
- Version 1.0.0	Initial Release on mod.io (within "Mayan Treasures" version 4.1.0)


## Special Thanks and Credits

	- the entire Anno Team for a great game and the support of mods;
	- the Modding Community, whose great work is always a source of inspiration for me.


Have fun!
