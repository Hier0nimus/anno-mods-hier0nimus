Quay Streets for Enbesa and Arctic.

This mod is not compatible with the quay streets included in the Shared_Objects_MU / Streets_Related_MU / Harbor Ornaments mod and other mods that make quay street for Enbesa and Arctic.
Loading is set to "after", so it overrides quay streets from the mod above, otherwise the textures will be changed and won't match.
Using this mod will replace quay streets for Enbesa and Artic in Streets_Related_MU / Harbor Ornaments.

If you have Shared_Objects_MU + Streets_Related_MU / Harbor Ornaments and you like the quay streets it contains - you don't need to install this mod. It's for people who don't have the mods listed or want a different look for these streets.
