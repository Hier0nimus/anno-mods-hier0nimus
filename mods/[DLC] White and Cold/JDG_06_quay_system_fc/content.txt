Buildable Quay System with full corners for all regions.

This mod adds the buildable quay system used in "Docklands", for all regions. No more pointy and weird quay ends.
Available in the harbor menu after unlocking it in a given region next to the standard quay.
Standard quay system for Arctic you find in mod "Arctic Quay" from "Spice it Up".

For modders:
This mod contains also new "Quay System Colony03 Base full corners" for Arctic which was missing and you can use it in your harbor buildings (it is also used in my "Bulid On The Water" mod). GUID's 2077023021 and 2077023022:
